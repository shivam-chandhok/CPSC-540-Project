Code Repo for Course project (CPSC 540)


We use the publicly available open clip code repository \url{https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip} for getting pre-trained CLIP and CoCa models. For BLIP2, we use the official code base from LAVIS repository. For perturbing image with different levels of common corruptions we use the publicly available imagecorruptions library \url{https://github.com/bethgelab/imagecorruptions}
